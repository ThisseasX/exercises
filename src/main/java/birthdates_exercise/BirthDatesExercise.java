     • Has a Person class with:
     ° String name
     ° String dateOfBirth

     • Has a List of Person instances

     • Sort the people list by age from oldest to youngest

     Person thiss = new Person("Thiss", "07/08/1992"):

     should print:
     "Hello! My name is Thiss, I am 27 years old, and I was born on Friday!"
